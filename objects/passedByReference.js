/* Objects are passed by reference. This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object. As a result, functions
 which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently(even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

 Our function paintIt() permanently changed the color of our spaceship object. However, reassignment of the spaceship variable wouldn’t work in the same way:
 
let spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'red'
};
let tryReassignment = obj => {
  obj = {
    identified : false, 
    'transport type' : 'flying'
  }
  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
 
};
tryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.
spaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};
 
spaceship = {
  identified : false, 
  'transport type': 'flying'
}; // Regular reassignment still works.
